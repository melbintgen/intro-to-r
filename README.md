### Description

This repository includes material for a hands-on workshop 'Introduction to R for biologists'. We show you some basics in R programming and some powerful things R can do *(tthat you cannot do with Excel)*. The aim is to give beginners the confidence to continue learning R. The focus is on data wrangling and visualisation of biological data (RNA-seq), as we believe this is a productive and engaging way to start learning R.
